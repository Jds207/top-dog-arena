# Subdomain Strategy for Top Dog Arena

This document outlines the planned subdomain structure for the Top Dog Arena NFT card project, providing a scalable architecture for different aspects of the platform.

## Subdomain Architecture

| Subdomain | Purpose | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `players.topdogarena.com` | Personalized athlete portals | Individual player statistics, media galleries, NFT perks, and fan engagement features |
| `sports.topdogarena.com` | Real-world sports tie-ins | Parody leagues, sports expansion content, and integration with actual sports data |
| `nft.topdogarena.com` | NFT marketplace & minting | NFT creation, redemption systems, and XRPL wallet integration |
| `vote.topdogarena.com` | Fan voting interface | Community voting for battles, rankings, and platform decisions |
| `admin.topdogarena.com` | Internal dashboard | Management interface for cards, players, contests, and platform administration |
| `api.topdogarena.com` | Backend API endpoints | RESTful API services for frontend communication and third-party integrations |
| `docs.topdogarena.com` | Documentation portal | Developer documentation, legal disclaimers, metadata schemas, and API references |

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Each subdomain can be deployed independently using micro-frontend architecture
- Angular Module Federation can be used to share common components across subdomains
- Consistent authentication/authorization across all subdomains
- Shared design system and component library

### Infrastructure
- DNS configuration for subdomain routing
- SSL certificates for all subdomains
- Load balancing and CDN considerations
- Environment-specific subdomain configurations (dev, staging, prod)

### Security
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration
- Subdomain isolation for sensitive operations (admin, API)
- Single sign-on (SSO) implementation across subdomains

## Future Expansion

This subdomain structure allows for:
- Independent scaling of different platform features
- Team-based development and deployment
- A/B testing of specific features
- Geographic or demographic-based routing
- Third-party integrations and partnerships
