# Top Dog Arena

Welcome to the official repository for the Top Dog Arena project. This project is focused on building a next-generation platform for athlete-based digital and physical collectibles.

## Project Vision

Top Dog Arena aims to create a unique ecosystem for fans to engage with their favorite athletes through a series of collectible cards, including physical "paper cards" and exclusive "rare earth cards." Each card will be linked to a unique digital experience, including a dedicated website with stats and videos, and will be backed by XRP ledger NFTs.

## Key Features

- **Athlete-Centric NFTs**: Digital trading cards as NFTs on the XRP ledger.
- **Physical Collectibles**: High-quality paper and rare earth cards for collectors.
- **Dynamic Content**: Each card unlocks a unique website with athlete stats, videos, and more.
- **Community Engagement**: A built-in chat interface for fans and athletes.
- **XRP Integration**: Seamless payments and NFT management using the XRP ledger.
